@dorimonson Are you denying you deny the scientific consensus that humans are causing the climate to change? Or you just being pedantic with my wording? https://t.co/1zGYaKgoZM https://t.co/ctLUR1fS4w,"As I've pointed out, you can have absolute gridlock here in the summer, and if
there isn't a forest fire nearby, then the skies can be beautiful and pristine and
clear as can be. But if a lightning strike causes a forest fire, then all of a sudden
we are engulfed in smoke. It is proof that man's role in carbon emissions is
insignificant. As l've said before, carbon-based transportation represents about
100 years of the 4.5 billion years of our planet; a lightning strike and ensuing
wildfire emits hundreds or maybe even thousands of times the amount of carbon
of all of our cars put together.

Corona virus awareness
This is from a doctor in Hong Kong who consulted with his
friend (who currently works on SARS prevention research)
on some effective ways to prevent the Coronavirus. Worth a
read.
About the virus:
1. It is pretty large in size (cell is about 400-500nm
diameter), so any normal mask (not just the N95 feature)
should be able to filter it out. However, when someone who's
infected sneezes in front of you, it will take a great 3 meters
(about 10 feet) before it drops to the ground and is no longer
airborne.
2. When the virus drops on metal surface, it will live for at
least 12 hours. So remember if you come in contact with any
metal surface, wash your hands with soap thoroughly.
3. The virus can remain active on fabric for 6-12 hours.
Normal laundry detergent should kill the virus. But if you are
really worried, you can add some non-chlorine bleach or
oxygen bleach . For winter clothing that does not require
daily washing, you can put it out under the sun to kill the
virus.
About the symptoms of the pneumonia caused by
Coronavirus:
1. It will first infect the throat, so the throat will have the dry
sore throat feeling which will last for 3 to 4 days
2. Then the virus will blend into the nasal fluid and drips into
the trachea and enter the lungs, causing pneumonia. This
process will take 5 to 6 days.
3. With pneumonia, comes high fever and difficulty in
breathing. The nasal congestion is not like the normal kind.
You will feel like you are drowning in water. It's important to
go seek immediate medical attention if you feel like this.

What We Do..
We help school boards, student councils, PTA's, and teacher's

• Drive a paradigm shift so people recognize climate change as
a generational justice issue.
Clearly articulate the political will for all elected leaders to

Overview
This webpage provides information for workers and employers about the evolving

Workers' Rights

Control and Prevention (CDC), Chinese authorities identified the new coronavirus, which
has resulted in confirmed human infections in China and exported cases outside of China,
including in the United States, Thailand, Japan, and South Korea. China also has reported
spread of the virus from infected patients to healthcare workers.
Existing OSHA standards apply
to protecting workers from 2019
novel coronavirus (2019-nCov).
• The 2019-nCov can cause
pneumonia, which may be
severe.
There is no evidence of ongoing transmission of 2019-nCov in the United States at this
time. Without sustained human-to-human transmission, most American workers are not at
significant risk of infection. However, workers involved in airline operations (including cabin
crewmembers), healthcare (including clinical laboratory personnel), and border protection
• Signs and symptoms of infection
include fever, cough, and
shortness of breath. People
infected with the virus may have

Homes destroyed by the Carr fire in Redding, California, on July 27.
THERE HAS BEEN a lot of burning lately. In late July, wildfires
broke out in the Arctic Circle, where temperatures reached
almost 90 degrees and roiled northern Sweden. Farther south,
wildfires swept along the Greek seaside, outside Athens, killing
at least 91 and hospitalizing almost 200. At one resort, dozens
tried to escape the flames by descending a narrow stone stair-
case into the Aegean, only to be engulfed along the way, dying
literally in each other's arms.
In the American West, 89 major wildfires have burned this year,
including one, in California, that grew at the rate of 1,000 acres
each hour and another, in Colorado, that produced a volcanolike
300-foot eruption of flames, swallowing an entire subdivision and
leading to the invention of a new term-""fire tsunami."" Then came
the Carr fire, which burned through Redding, California. It

Government of India
Novel Coronavirus
Frequently Asked Questions
Q) How does the virus spread ?
Ans- The specific modes of transmission of the virus is not clear yet since
it is a novel virus. This virus probably originally emerged from an
animal source but now seems to be spreading from
person-to-person. It's not clear yet how easily 2019-nCoV spreads
from person-to-person. It is thought to have happened mainly when
an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how influenza and
other respiratory pathogens spread.
Q) What is Gol doing about 2019-nCoV?
Ans- A 24*7 helpline has been setup by the Gol at NCDC, New Delhi to
answer all queries regarding the disease. The Gol is closely
monitoring the situation and has ascertained the level of
preparedness in every State of India. As this is an emerging, rapidly
evolving situation the Gol will continue to provide updated
information as it becomes available.
Q) Is there a vaccine to get protection from 2019 novel Corona Virus ?
Ans- Currently, there is no vaccine available to protect against
2019- novel Corona Virus.

An important aspect of the FBI's assessment of Steele's election reporting
involved evaluating Steele's source network, especially whether the sub-sources
had access to reliable information. As noted in the first FISA application, Steele
relied on a primary sub-source (Primary Sub-source) for information, and this
Primary Sub-source used a network of sub-sources to gather the information that
was relayed to Steele; Steele himself was not the originating source of any of the
factual information in his reporting.334 The FBI employed multiple methods in an
effort to ascertain the identities of the sub-sources within the network, including
meeting with Steele in October 2016 (prior to him being closed for cause) and
conducting various investigative inquiries. For example, the FBI determined it was
plausible that at least some of the sub-sources had access to intelligence pertinent
to events described in Steele's election reporting. Additionally, the FBI's evaluation
of Steele's sub-sources generated some corroboration for the election reporting
(primarily routine facts about dates, locations, and occupational positions that was
mostly public source information). Further, by January 2017 the FBI was able to
identify and arrange a meeting with the Primary Sub-source. 335
The FBI conducted interviews of the Primary Sub-source in January, March,
and May 2017 that raised significant questions about the reliability of the Steele
election reporting. In particular, the FBI's interview with Steele's Primary Sub-

I wanted to post this comment conversation on my Elliot Rodger video. Not to shame this guy but because I think it can be helpful at clarifying some of my points in the video. https://t.co/X8JLpWQLmB,"YouTopia • 17 hours ago (edited)
Wait, are you really arguing that we shouldn't
consider pesky historical facts when they get in the
way of our narrative? isn't that just actual feels over
facts irrationalism? How do you decide what's
""evident"" and what's ""mystification"" if evidence isn't
valid?
When I see Rodger, first and foremost I see a
narcissist who took refuge in any kind of fringe
belief that allowed him to maintain a certain self-
image. The ""what"" he took refuge in is just what you
have described it to be, but that doesn't mean that
you can lay his behaviour entirely or even primarily
at the feet of that ideology. I'd consider the
psychological explanation what's evident and the
political framing the mystification.
