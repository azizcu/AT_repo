76,76,76,coronavirus gender and ethnic susceptibility to 2019-nCoV https://t.co/y1r4uv0CGQ,"| Wuhan Virus Updates
gender and ethnic susceptibility to 2019-nCoV
Entry of Corona-chan into lung cells is through cell surface
expression of ACE2(angiotensin converting enzyme 2), which
Corona-chan recognizes with the bling of her crown (the
projections of her eponymous Corona).
This is identical to the mechanism used by SARS-Coronavirus.
The significance of this finding can be inferred from known
expression of this enzyme on the surfaces of lung cells.
It is known that males have 30% higher expression of the enzyme
than females across all population groups. This fits with
observations that most of the deaths and infected patients are
males.
A second association that goes toward explaining the outbreak is
the association between ethnic group and enzyme expression.
A study on hypertension across three population groups (White
European, African, South Asian) found that hypertension
prevalence and ACE2 expression was proportionally linked, with
the highest of the three (South Asian) being 10% more than the
African and 35% more than the European cohorts.
The statistics here go a long way to explaining why the previous
SARS outbreak did little damage beyond Chinese borders and
shows the susceptibility of the Chinese population to zoonotic
Coronavirus infections, debunking theories that Corona-chan is a
test tube baby

It was such a toxic thing to
begin with, it enforced the idea
that men can't be loving and
affectionate to their friends
without being told they are gay
FOR YEARS!! even if they were
together it was their business
and decision to not tell us.

Cyber Security
Small Charity Guide
This advice has been produced to help charities protect themselves
from the most common cyber attacks. The 5 topics covered are easy to
understand and cost little to implement. Read our quick tips below, or
find out more at www.ncsc.gov.uk/charity.
a part of GCHO
Backing up your data
Preventing malware damage
Using passwords to
Take regular backups of your important
data, and test they can be restored. This
will reduce the inconvenience of any
data loss from theft, fire, other
physical damage, or ransomware.
You can protect your charity from the
damage caused by 'malware' (malicious
software, including viruses) by adopting
some simple and low-cost techniques.
protect your data
Passwords - when implemented
correctly - are a free, easy and
effective way to prevent
unauthorised people from
accessing your devices and data.
Identify what needs to be backed up. Normally this
will comprise documents, emails, contacts, legal
information, calendars, financial records and
supporter or beneficiary databases.
Use antivirus software on all computers and laptops.
Only install approved software on tablets and
smartphones, and prevent users from downloading
third party apps from unknown sources.
Patch all software and firmware by promptly
applying the latest software updates provided by
manufacturers and vendors. Use the 'automatically
update' option where available.
Make sure all laptops, MACS and PCs
use encryption products that require a
password to boot. Switch on password/
PIN protection or fingerprint
recognition for mobile devices.
Ensure the device containing your backup is not
permanently connected to the device holding the
original copy, neither physically nor over a local
network.
Consider backing up to the cloud. This means your
data is stored in a separate location (away from
your offices/devices), and you'll also be able to
access it quickly, from anywhere.
Control access to removable media such as SD cards
and USB sticks. Consider disabling ports, or limiting
access to sanctioned media. Encourage staff to
transfer files via email or cloud storage instead.
Use two factor authentication (2FA)
for important websites like banking
and email, if you're given the option.
Switch on your firewall (included with most
operating systems) to create a buffer zone between
your network and the Internet.
Avoid using predictable passwords
(such as family and pet names). Avoid
the most common passwords that
criminals can guess (like password).
Keeping your smartphones
(and tablets) safe
Smartphones and tablets
(which are used outside the
safety of the office and home)
need even more protection than 'desktop' equipment.
Avoiding phishing attacks
In phishing attacks, scammers send fake
emails asking for sensitive information
(such as bank details), or containing links
to bad websites.
Do not enforce regular password
changes; they only need to be changed
when you suspect a compromise.
Change the manufacturers' default
**T passwords that devices are issued with,
before they are distributed to staff.
Switch on PIN/password protection/fingerprint
recognition for mobile devices.
Ensure staff don't browse the web or check emails
from an account with Administrator privileges. This
will reduce the impact of successful phishing attacks.
Provide secure storage so staff can
write down passwords and keep
them safe (but not with the
device). Ensure staff can reset
their own passwords, easily.
Configure devices so that when lost or stolen they
can be tracked, remotely wiped or remotely locked.
Scan for malware and change passwords as soon as
possible if you suspect a successful attack has
occurred. Don't punish staff if they get caught out
(it discourages people from reporting in the future).
Keep your devices (and all installed apps) up to date,
using the 'automatically update' option if available.
Consider using a password
manager. If you do use one,
make sure that the 'master'
password (that provides
access to all your other
passwords) is a
strong one.
When sending sensitive data, don't connect to public
Wi-Fi hotspots - use 3G or 4G connections (including
tethering and wireless dongles) or use VPNS.
****
Check for obvious signs of phishing, like poor
spelling and grammar, or low quality versions of
recognisable logos. Does the sender's email address
look legitimate, or is it trying to mimic someone
you know?
Replace devices that are no longer supported by
manufacturers with up-to-date alternatives.

MOH Health Bulletin to the Public:
The Upper Respiratory Infection affecting China at present is quite serious. The virus causing it is very
potent and is resistant to existing antibiotics.
(virus is not bacterial infection hence cannot be treated by antibiotics).
The prevention method now is to keep your throat moist, do not let your throat dry up. Thus do not hold
your thirst because once your membrane in your throat is dried, the virus will invade into your body within
10 mins. Drink 50-80cc warm water, 30-50cc for kids, according to age. Everytime you feel your throat is
dry, do not wait, keep water in hand. Do not drink plenty at one time as it does not help; instead, continue to
keep throat moist. Till end of March, do not go to crowded places, wear mask as needed especially in train
or public transportation.
Avoid fried or spicy food and load up vitamin C.
The symptoms/ description are:
1. Repeated high fever.
2. Prolonged coughing after fever.
3. Children are more prone.
4. Adults usually feel uneasy, headache and mainly respiratory related illness.
This illness is highly contagious. Let's continue to pray and wait for further notice about the infection.

Dear Governor,
Per our discussion of today, Gulf Coast Funds Management EB-5 Regional Center currently has 83
pending EB-5 petitions at USCIS.
This means $41.5 million in stranded capital that should have been invested long ago in Tunica, MS,
and would have already created 830 jobs. As the attached chart indicates, many of these
applications have been pending far beyond the USCIS stated processing goal of 5 months. In
addition, 4 qualified investors ($2 million/40 jobs) just withdrew their funds due to the long delay
and chose to invest in a Canadian immigration investor program. A big loss to America and
Mississippi. We are concerned that this could start a stampede of investors asking for their money
back and investing in other countries. Senators Cochran and Wicker have both called USCIS Director
Alejandro Mayorkas and I recently met with Secretary Napolitano to voice my displeasure with the
program.
Mayorkas also has a connection to Anthony Rodham at Gulf Coast. Specifically, after
Anthony's brother, Hugh Rodham, received $200,000 in 2001 to lobby for clemency for a
convicted cocaine dealer and son of a major Democratic Party donor, Mayorkas-at the time a

534,534,534,"My household's one-year experience with a residential heat pump water heater suggests that other households too could meaningfully cut their #carbon pollution contribution to #climatechange, especially if the devices are powered by #wind or #solar.   #energyefficiency https://t.co/GkrEGYZgvr","OUR FIRST-YEAR EXPERIENCE WITH A HEAT PUMP WATER HEATER
Sinth
Our two-person household considers climate change an urgent problem. So far, wve have cut our house's carbon
dioxide emissions by nearly 10,000 pounds per year. Here's a quick story about our most recent climate action.
In May 2017, we replaced our old natural gas-fired hot water heater with a heat pump water heater. This
appliance produces hot water by extracting heat from the ambient air surrounding it, employing the same
technology that refrigerators and air conditioners use to perform their work.
The highest-rated conventional storage water heaters and tankless water heaters have at best energy factors of 0.7
for natural gas units and 0.96 for electric resistance ones-meaning that at most 70 and 96 percent of the heat
produced by these heaters actually gets transferred to the water stored inside them. Heat pump water heaters,
however, can achieve energy factors of 2.0 or higher because these devices do not make heat but rather merely
transfer it from the surrounding air to the water inside the tank.
We now have a full year's worth of data and have analyzed the numbers. Replacing our gas water heater with a
heat pump water heater reduced our family's natural gas needs by at least 80 therms. Combusting one therm of
natural gas emits 11 pounds of carbon dioxide. Therefore, our household cut carbon dioxide pollution by at least
880 pounds per year with just this one climate action.
To power the new heat pump water heater, our electricity use increased by nine percent over the course of the
first year of operation. But since we pay on average seven cents extra per day to get the equivalent of 100 percent
of our power from Xcel Energy's Windsource, we achieved this big carbon reduction without adding any new
carbon pollution.
An additional bonus we have enjoyed is a dehumidified basement. Heat pump water heaters dehumidify as they
extract heat energy from the surrounding air. You may be able to reduce or even eliminate your use of a
basement dehumidifier.
Heat pump water heaters won't be right for every home. Since it works by extracting heat energy from the air
surrounding the device, it makes our basement cooler, drier and thus more comfortable in the summer. But it
also makes the basement colder in the winter. We use our basement only for laundry and storage, so a colder
basement in the winter causes us no discomfort. But a heat pump water heater may not be right for you if you
have a basement recreation room.
Fighting global warming will require that we find effective, affordable ways to use renewable energy to replace

Sinth
Our two-person household considers climate change an urgent problem. So far, wve have cut our house's carbon
dioxide emissions by nearly 10,000 pounds per year. Here's a quick story about our most recent climate action.
In May 2017, we replaced our old natural gas-fired hot water heater with a heat pump water heater. This
appliance produces hot water by extracting heat from the ambient air surrounding it, employing the same
technology that refrigerators and air conditioners use to perform their work.
The highest-rated conventional storage water heaters and tankless water heaters have at best energy factors of 0.7
for natural gas units and 0.96 for electric resistance ones-meaning that at most 70 and 96 percent of the heat
produced by these heaters actually gets transferred to the water stored inside them. Heat pump water heaters,
however, can achieve energy factors of 2.0 or higher because these devices do not make heat but rather merely
transfer it from the surrounding air to the water inside the tank.
We now have a full year's worth of data and have analyzed the numbers. Replacing our gas water heater with a
heat pump water heater reduced our family's natural gas needs by at least 80 therms. Combusting one therm of
natural gas emits 11 pounds of carbon dioxide. Therefore, our household cut carbon dioxide pollution by at least
880 pounds per year with just this one climate action.
To power the new heat pump water heater, our electricity use increased by nine percent over the course of the
first year of operation. But since we pay on average seven cents extra per day to get the equivalent of 100 percent
of our power from Xcel Energy's Windsource, we achieved this big carbon reduction without adding any new
carbon pollution.
An additional bonus we have enjoyed is a dehumidified basement. Heat pump water heaters dehumidify as they
extract heat energy from the surrounding air. You may be able to reduce or even eliminate your use of a
basement dehumidifier.
Heat pump water heaters won't be right for every home. Since it works by extracting heat energy from the air
surrounding the device, it makes our basement cooler, drier and thus more comfortable in the summer. But it
also makes the basement colder in the winter. We use our basement only for laundry and storage, so a colder
basement in the winter causes us no discomfort. But a heat pump water heater may not be right for you if you
have a basement recreation room.
Fighting global warming will require that we find effective, affordable ways to use renewable energy to replace
natural gas and other fossil fuels to heat our water and heat and cool our homes and businesses. We encourage
you to consider a heat pump water heater when you next need to replace your existing unit.

South Korea Will Create A Cryptocurrency
For Citizen Rewards
The Seoul Metropolitan Government
will establish its first blockchain-based
administrative services in November,
according to a report in the korean-
language blockinpress.
At a conference held last month and at-
tended by city officials and representatives
of the private sector, specifics of the roll
out were discussed, with timelines and goals
established. The meeting seemed to revive
an initiative that had lost some momentum
since fƒ±rst being announced late last year.
Three priorities were
the November deadline. The city's block-
chain points system will be introduced and
residents of Seoul will receive s-coins for
for completion by
the use of public services. They will be able
to redeem those points for rewards. Services
that generate the coins include paying taxes
and participating in public opinion polls.
Seoul's point system will integrated with
Zeropay, a city-government sponsored
QR-code-enabled network established last
December. It allows customers to pay for
goods and services using their phones and
does not charge merchants commissions.

626,626,626,The VA is preparing to provide care for and prevent the spread of the #coronavirus. Their advice is good for all of us. https://t.co/Z3Qye3EYaq,"MESSAGE FROM THE EXECUTIVE IN CHARGE
January 30, 2020
Novel Coronavirus Disease
We are closely monitoring an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel (new)
coronavirus that was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Thousands of
cases have been identified in China, with more than 100 fatalities. Additional cases
have been identified throughout the world, including the United States.
VA is closely tracking the occurrence of novel coronavirus in the United States and
prepared to protect the Veterans within the VA health care system and the employees
who serve them. Meanwhile, here are some important points I want to emphasize:
1. The illness is spread by respiratory droplets, similar to influenza, and symptoms
can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, which may appear 2-14 days
after exposure. There is much more to learn about the transmission and severity
of the coronavirus, and updates are available on the CDC webpage.
2. Our VHA Emergency Management Coordination Team is working with the Centers
for Disease Control and will stay on top of this situation as it changes. We are
working to be as prepared as possible so that each facility has a plan and training
to assess and begin the care of any Veteran or staff who arrives needing an
evaluation for potential exposure.
3. We will continually update you and the Veteran community as we receive more
information.
There is currently no vaccine to prevent an infection, although there are concentrated
efforts to develop and test solutions. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being
exposed to this virus, with everyday_preventive actions such as:
‚Ä¢ Getting a flu shot.
‚Ä¢ Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
(suggestion: scrub while humming the ""Happy Birthday"" song from beginning to
end twice).
‚Ä¢ Using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
Avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoiding close contact with people who are sick.
‚Ä¢ Staying home when you are sick or becoming sick.
‚Ä¢ Covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
‚Ä¢ Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.
Avoiding all non-essential travel to China.
‚Ä¢ If you do travel to China, call employee health before returning to work.
These basic health measures can make a huge difference in reducing the spread of
infection and can save lives.

RCMPV St. Roch is a Royal Canadian Mounted Police schooner, the first ship to completely
circumnavigate North America, and the second sailing vessel to complete a voyage through
the Northwest Passage. She was the first ship to complete the Northwest Passage in the
direction west to east (Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean), going the same route that Amundsen
on the sailing vessel Gj√∏a went east to west, 38 years earlier.
The ship was most often captained by
Henry Larsen.[2]
Liverpool born Sgt. Fred S. Farrar
R.C.M.P. (1901-1954) was a crew member
of St. Roch for various voyages including
the 1950 voyage that circumnavigated

Heritage in the Age of Climate Change
The movement to preserve our built heritage has changed
dramatically over the last 50 years. Environmental issues have become
a major consideration. ""Cities, and the buildings which comprise them,
account for more than 75% of the world's greenhouse gasses. That's the
bad news. The good news is that building super-efficient new buildings
doesn't help fix the problem: rehabilitating and repurposing old
buildings does. As Carl Elephante, president of the American Institute of
Architects says, 'the greenest building is one that's already built."" Erik
Hanson, Heritage Resources Coordinator for the City of Peterborough,
will explain why heritage is the emerging champion in the race to zero
net carbon and discuss what municipalities and the private sector can do
to support the sustainable rehabilitation of existing buildings.

Using science to sell apps: Evaluation of mental health app
store quality claims
Mark Erik Larsen', Kit Huckvale', Jennifer Nicholas?, John Torous, Louise Birrell"", Emily Li' and Bill Reda'
Despite the emergence of curated app libraries for mental health apps, personal searches by consumers remain a common method
for discovering apps. App store descriptions therefore represent a key channel to inform consumer choice. This study examined the
claims invoked through these app store descriptions, the extent to which scientific language is used to support such claims, and the
corresponding evidence in the literature. Google Play and iTunes were searched for apps related to depression, self-harm,
substance use, anxiety, and schizophrenia. The descriptions of the top-ranking, consumer-focused apps were coded to identify
claims of acceptability and effectiveness, and forms of supporting statement. For apps which invoked ostensibly scientific
principles, a literature search was conducted to assess their credibility. Seventy-three apps were coded, and the majority (64%)
claimed effectiveness at diagnosing a mental health condition, or improving symptoms, mood or self-management. Scientific
language was most frequently used to support these effectiveness claims (44%), although this included techniques not validated by
literature searches (8/24 = 33%). Two apps described low-quality, primary evidence to support the use of the app. Only one app
included a citation to published literature. A minority of apps (14%) described design or development involving lived experience,
and none referenced certification or accreditation processes such as app libraries. Scientific language was the most frequently
invoked form of support for use of mental health apps; however, high-quality evidence is not commonly described. Improved
knowledge translation strategies may improve the adoption of other strategies, such as certification or lived experience co-design.

Calving Indicates TOO MUCH ICE!
Redford: Time to step up game on climate change - CNN.com
We know what's driving the problem of climate change, and we know what to do
about it, writes Robert Redford.
Climate morons believe that glaciers calving are an indication of ""climate change""
Glaciers are rivers of ice that flow towards the sea. Snow falls in the interior, and
eventually finds its way to the ocean via gravity. All of the snow that falls, has to return to
the sea. In the case of Greenland, that is 500 billion tons of ice per year.
Their logic is as intelligent as saying all the water flowing out the mouth of the Mississippi
is an indication of drought. Complete imbeciles.

Interpretation The 2019-aCoV infection was of chustering onset, is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities,
and can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. In general, d
characteristics of patients who died were in line with the MulBSTA score, an early warning model for predicting e
mortality in viral pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to esplore the applicability of the MulBSTA KOre in tat

Stabilization wedges: solving the
climate problem for the next 50
years with current technologies
Stephen Pacala, Robert Socolow
science 305 (5686), 968-972, 2004
Humanity already possesses the fundamental
scientific, technical, and industrial know-how
to solve the carbon and climate problem for
the next half-century. A portfolio of
technologies now exists to meet the world9s
energy needs over the next 50 years and limit
atmospheric CO2 to a trajectory that avoids a
doubling of the preindustrial concentration.
Every element in this portfolio has passed
beyond the laboratory bench and
demonstration project; many are already
implemented somewhere at full industrial
scale. Although no element is a credible
candidate for doing the entire job (or even half
the job) by itself, the portfolio as a whole is
large enough that not every element has to be
used.

I'm one of the millions in Wuhan right now who is
affected by this. It is heartbreaking to see comments
here saying how we deserve it.
Yes. Some people are disgusting and uneducated, they
eat everything that moves and have total disregard for
health/safety regulations. But most people aren't like
that. Most of us are just normal folks living a normal life.
We are just as angry at those exotic animal traders as
you are, if not more.
It's CNY, and in case you're not familiar with the Chinese
culture, let me first put into perspective it's importance.
It's like thanksgiving and Christmas combined.
Historical/Traditional significance aside, for millions of
people, CNY is the only time of the year where families
get to reunite and have a home cooked meal together. It
is more common than not for chinese people in more
rural areas to go to cities to find better work
opportunities. They work hard for the whole year,
sending home the little money they earn to support their
children and parents. Families don't get to see each
other for a whole year and reunion dinner on CNY eve is
something everyone looks forward to.
The coronavirus is taking away the only time of the year
that families get to reunite. Doctors and nurses are
working around the clock, many of them have not gone
home in weeks; healthcare professionals across China
are flying voluntarily to Wuhan to help; factory workers
have resumed work due to the shortage of masks and
protective suits; 3M and other companies are donating
masks too; hotels across Wuhan have offered free
accomodation to healthcare professionals whose home
are too far away; chain convenient stores are providing
free hot meals to hospitals and workers; delivery man
have to give up their holidays to deliver food to families
because we can't leave our homes; construction workers
are working around the clock to build new hospitals... do

Did Isaac Newton Need Peer Review?
Peer review is cargo cult science. Exhaustive attempts to prove it raises
research quality have come up empty. On the other hand, its
shortcomings (inconsistency, superficiality, subjectivity, inability to
detect fraud, tribalism) are legion. If a series of pre-publication steps are
followed, goes this cargo cult thinking, sound science is the end result.
Academia has mythologized peer review. In that universe, it isn't a
mundane editorial tool, but a sacred process by which unpublished
research gets elevated and anointed and transformed into 'real' work
you can point to when applying for grants and promotions.
One of the dirty little secrets of this mythology is that journals have
always been at liberty to define peer review however they please.
External oversight, enforcement, and minimum standards have never
been part of the picture.

Did Isaac Newton Need Peer Review?
Peer review is cargo cult science. Exhaustive attempts to prove it raises
research quality have come up empty. On the other hand, its
shortcomings (inconsistency, superficiality, subjectivity, inability to
detect fraud, tribalism) are legion. If a series of pre-publication steps are
followed, goes this cargo cult thinking, sound science is the end result.
Academia has mythologized peer review. In that universe, it isn't a
mundane editorial tool, but a sacred process by which unpublished
research gets elevated and anointed and transformed into 'real' work
you can point to when applying for grants and promotions.
One of the dirty little secrets of this mythology is that journals have
always been at liberty to define peer review however they please.
External oversight, enforcement, and minimum standards have never
been part of the picture.

the alarmists want us to go back & look long-term, then let's at least go back to 1900. As
the chart below shows, Arctic sea ice extent was similarly low some 90 years ago, a time
when atmospheric CO2 was at what we are told are climatically very ""safe levels"".
Sea ice has nothing to do with atmospheric CO2
8.0
7.0
6.0
i Alarmists like to
start chart here,
5.0
But ignore this!
Arctic Sea Ice Extent (September) 1900-2013 reconstructed
-Alekseev et al., 2016 (reconstructed September Arctic sea ice extent, 1900-2013) as shown in Connolly et al., 2017-
1960
Arctic sea ice extent is clearly driven by the natural temperature
cycles of the North Atlantic with a stunnungly strong correlation.

Someone else noticed this yesterday and I capped it just in case it came up again.

First of all, read the pic. That's the first part you need to be aware of.
Have you done that? Good. Now listen.
In China they have fever clinics. Now these fever clinics acts like a screening for the hospitals. If you have a fever, you don't visit the hospital first. you go to a fever clinic.
http://www.timeoutshanghai.com/features/Blog-Health_Wellness/72154/Here-are-Shanghais-designated-fever-clinics.html
In the Hubei reports, they have included the amount of people visiting fever clinics, and the amount of people ""seen"", which I guess is a shit translation. but I would assume that is people
they could check.

>On January 28. a total of 32.309 people were treated for fever clinics in the province, and 4,095 people were seen (actual translation, stay, meaning they were admitted)
But if I'm reading this correctly, this means that 32309 people came with symptoms to fever clinics in Hubei district, and 4095 people could be treated, out of these there were 1032 cases
of pneumonia.
This means that 1 in 4 people get pneumonia.
>Many of the patients I interviewed said they showed all the signs of coronavirus infection but couldn't get a confirmed diagnosis for lack of definitive testing.
>When I visited the Red Cross Hospital Wednesday, the main hall was crowded with people wearing masks as the sounds of coughing echoed through the air. Many of the patients in the
hallways had IV drips while others waited anxiously to be tested or treated.
>Several people showed me their CT scan results. which were highly suggestive of coronavirus infection, but they said they were yet to receive a confirmed diagnosis and thus couldn't be
admitted to the hospital.
>i know I am probably a mobile source of virus, but there is nothing I can do if the hospital doesn't receive me."" said a suspected coronavirus patient surnamed Li. He told me he was
unable to get the virus test because the hospital ran out of testing kits. As patients are mixed in the hospital, the risk of cross-infection is massive, he said.
>A doctor at the Red Cross Hospital said only a few public hospitals in Wuhan were equipped with testing gear for the new coronavirus and the Red Cross Hospital was not among them. The
hospital can only report suspected cases to the provincial disease control center, which will take samples for testing. It is unclear how many tests the center has done, but when I asked six
people with lung infections showing on their CT scans at the Red Cross Hospital, none of them had received a test.

groups overseas in an effort to control the

Australia's tourism industry, which is already
reeling from months of devastating bushfires
and relies heavily on visitors from China.

To clarify my position on government regulations: I am not generally in favor
of regulations. The fewer, the better. But there are exceptions.
For example, I believe we can all agree that it would be outright crazy to
allow anyone to handle certain aerosol-transmissible pathogens. In this
case, we demand strict regulations. This is because we know that if
something goes wrong, it might affect a lot of people, including us.
Now I believe that certain algorithms, such as Google's search algorithm,
which affect billions of people, are also one of those exceptions. We need to
make sure that these algorithms are not abused for large scale public
opinion manipulations. We need to enforce the transparency, verifiability,
accountability and security of these algorithms.
The temporary deletion of Trump's Twitter account should have been a
wake-up call. Even if we were to trust these companies not to manipulate us
in their own interest, or the interest of a government, one rogue employ with
sufficient access could at the right time wield unprecedented power.
Imagine a similar situation as the Cuban Missile Crisis. What could one
foreign agent or mentally unstable employee provoke by posting something
in the name of a head of state or by sending a few billion people a message
about imminent doom?
Right now we are in a situation in which street food is better regulated than
the products of companies that could affect election outcomes, cause mass
panics or even nuclear wars.

which affect billions of people, are also one of those exceptions. We need to
make sure that these algorithms are not abused for large scale public
opinion manipulations. We need to enforce the transparency, verifiability,
accountability and security of these algorithms.
The temporary deletion of Trump's Twitter account should have been a
wake-up call. Even if we were to trust these companies not to manipulate us
in their own interest, or the interest of a government, one rogue employ with
sufficient access could at the right time wield unprecedented power.
Imagine a similar situation as the Cuban Missile Crisis. What could one
foreign agent or mentally unstable employee provoke by posting something
in the name of a head of state or by sending a few billion people a message
about imminent doom?
Right now we are in a situation in which street food is better regulated than
the products of companies that could affect election outcomes, cause mass
panics or even nuclear wars.

The plastic industry creates billions and
billions of tonnes of carbon pollution
every year, which is the key cause of
climate change. For starters, most plastic
is made from oil or gas which are fossil
fuels that in turn use other fossil fuels to
be extracted from the ground. Then
there's the transportation, manufacturing

19) Now sea levels 135m down is a curious statistic. This
is because it exactly matches to the average depth of the
non-polar continental break, which is also about 135m
down depending on how we measure it. The continental
break is where the barely sloping continental shelf
abruptly becomes the continental edge, and a steep
descent to the deep sea floor, as shown below.

18) Now again, when new volcanic air comes up, it tends
to come up as a froth of super-high pressure gas and
super-hot magma from deep within the planet. The high
pressure gas accounts for how the froth rises, and how it
forces its way out through the lithosphere.
Figure 1.12
A phiogphic upaf the an shon i

As this super-hot magma cools, it gives off heat
warming Earth's oceans and surface. But in cooling, it also
accretes as rock the sea floor rift/ridge ‚Äì like a tongue
touched to frozen metal, but on geological time scale. So
while the bubbles of CO2-rich new volcanic air replenish
the atmosphere and bring up magma that warms the
surface, they also drive sea-floor spreading. Then this
seafloor spreading drives earthquakes, plate margin
volcanos, and continental drift. Thus these 'soda bottle'
gas bubbles are Gaia's primary driving force, directly or
indirectly giving rise to all active geology, as well as
atmosphere and climate. Here is why the full version of
this theory is also named ""The Unified Gaia Theory""
Note the abrupt edge at the continental break. The
average width of the continental shelf is 60km and the fall
is 135m, thus it has a remarkably shallow 0.225%-slope

19) Now sea levels 135m down is a curious statistic. This
is because it exactly matches to the average depth of the
non-polar continental break, which is also about 135m
down depending on how we measure it. The continental
break is where the barely sloping continental shelf
abruptly becomes the continental edge, and a steep
descent to the deep sea floor, as shown below.

18) Now again, when new volcanic air comes up, it tends
to come up as a froth of super-high pressure gas and
super-hot magma from deep within the planet. The high
pressure gas accounts for how the froth rises, and how it
forces its way out through the lithosphere.
Figure 1.12
A phiogphic upaf the an shon i

As this super-hot magma cools, it gives off heat
warming Earth's oceans and surface. But in cooling, it also
accretes as rock the sea floor rift/ridge ‚Äì like a tongue
touched to frozen metal, but on geological time scale. So
while the bubbles of CO2-rich new volcanic air replenish
the atmosphere and bring up magma that warms the
surface, they also drive sea-floor spreading. Then this
seafloor spreading drives earthquakes, plate margin
volcanos, and continental drift. Thus these 'soda bottle'
gas bubbles are Gaia's primary driving force, directly or
indirectly giving rise to all active geology, as well as
atmosphere and climate. Here is why the full version of
this theory is also named ""The Unified Gaia Theory""
Note the abrupt edge at the continental break. The
average width of the continental shelf is 60km and the fall
is 135m, thus it has a remarkably shallow 0.225%-slope
on average.

2056,2056,2056,A detailed statement from the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy @ngrcommtech! https://t.co/WJhXx8HEkm https://t.co/rgUQX0Mlcw,"PRESS STATEMENT
PRESIDENT MUHAMMADU BUHARI RENAMES COMMUNICATIONS MINISTRY
TO FEDERAL MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS AND DIGITAL ECONOMY
The President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari GCFR, has
granted the prayers of the Honourable Minister of Communications Dr Isa Ali
Ibrahim Pantami FNCS, FBCS, FIIM to properly position and empower the Ministry to
fulfill his Digital Economy objectives. The Ministry which supervises the ICT Sector
has been renamed The Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital
Economy to further expand its mandate to capture the goals of digitalization of the
Nigerian economy in line with the Economic Growth and Recovery Plan (EGRP), one
of the key agenda of the present administration.
According to the Honourable Minister, the former name was not only limiting in
pursuing the objectives of a digital economy, but obsolete as it did not reflect the
the trends as emphasized by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). 1ICT
contribution to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stood at 13.85% in the
second quarter of 2019. The change of nomenclature will propel the Ministry to
reposition its strategic objectives as laid out in the priority areas of this
administration while accelerating growth and social inclusion.
Dr Pantami cited examples of global and African economies like Scotland, Thailand,
Tunisia, Benin Republic and Burkina Faso among others who have adopted
deliberate strategies and created Ministries of Digital Economy in line with global
best practice, and especially the European Union which has a commissioner for
Digital Economy.
In a letter containing his approval, the President noted that the request is in line
with global best practice which will further reflect the priorities of his administration.
The approved name has been announced and adopted by the Federal Executive
Council today, 23 October 2019.

The premise of President Obama's Climate Action Plan is that there is an overwhelming judgment of

summarized by this statement from the President's Second Inaugural Address:

devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms.

with the 15+ year hiatus in global warming, there is growing appreciation for the importance of
natural climate variability

Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses that infect

Elrond Blockchain To Help Solidify
Crypto Liquidity Aggregator Orion
Elrond, a recently launched high-performance
blockchain network, announced it has
partnered with Orion Protocol to help solidify
its crypto liquidity platform.
Orion Protocol is a liquidity aggregator that
connects centralized and decentralized
exchanges to give cryptocurrency users
access to more volume and tighter spreads.
By deploying a set of smart contracts for
managing liquidity and matching and execut-
ing orders directly between different chains,
traders have access to more liquidity than
any single exchange and more markets that
they can trade with less friction and costs.

Department of Health
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY
DOH CONFIRMS FIRST 2019-NCOV CASE IN THE COUNTRY; ASSURES PUBLIC
OF INTENSIFIED CONTAINMENT MEASURES
Press Release / 30 January 2020
The Department of Health (DOH) today confirmed that a 38-year-old female Chinese patient
under investigation (PUI) is positive for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) after her laboratory
results arrived today from the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Laboratory in Melbourne,
Australia. DOH, however, continues to guarantee the public that all necessary precautionary
measures are being taken to halt the spread of the virus.
The confirmed case arrived in the Philippines from Wuhan, China via Hong Kong last January
21, 2020. The patient sought consult and was admitted in one of the country's government
hospitals last January 25 after experiencing mild cough. She is currently asymptomatic.
""I assure the public that the Department of Health is on top of this evolving situation. We were
able to detect the first confirmed case because of our strong surveillance system, close
co√≥rdination with World Health Organization and other national agencies, and the utilization of
DOH's decision tool. We are working closely with the hospital where the patient is admitted and
have activated the Incident Command System of the said hospital for appropriate management,
specifically on infection control, case management, and containment. We are also implementing
measures to protect the health staff providing care to these patients,"" Health Secretary Francisco
T. Duque III said.
DOH is also in close coordination with the Inter-agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious
Diseases (EID) which includes representatives of the Departments of Foreign Affairs (DFA),
Interior and Local Government (DILG), Justice (DOJ), Labor and Employment (DOLE),
Tourism (DOT), Transportation (DOTT), and Information and Communications Technology
(DICT). The Task Force will convene a high-level meeting tomorrow, January 31, 2020, to
discuss the first confirmed case and developments arising from this health event.
The Bureau of Quarantine remains on high alert and is in constant coordination with authorities
from all ports of entry for stricter border surveillance. DOH assured that its health facilities are
equipped and prepared to receive and care for PUIS and confirmed 2019-nCoV cases.

 USC aims to allow

https://t.co/aWTGXjh4ce https://t.co/OFODXWaArh","A decentralized cryptocurrency system can be launched by a single bank or
a number of banks who come together to facilitate payments or clearing and
settlement. In the case of a single bank, the bank may use the cryptocurrency within
its own network or give other users access to the system. In its labs, Citi is testing
CitiCoin, an open source Bitcoin-based digital currency, which will be used for global
payments and trade. Japan's Mitsubishi MUFG coin provides an example where the
system will be open to other users such as those currently on prepaid systems.
In the case where banks partner to launch a decentralized cryptocurrency, the DCL
is controlled by the members and a minimum number of members must sign the
block to make it valid. The banks will set up their own governance structure and
rules, and determine the supply and issue of the cryptocurrency. These systems
have to conform to KYB or KYC procedures. A good example of such a system is the
Utility Settlement Coin (USC).
Four banks, UBS, Deutsche Bank, Santander and BNY Mellon have joined forces
to create their own cryptocurrency, USC, which they plan to launch in 2018. The

to facilitate operations, reducing transactions time and costs. USC aims to allow

The main research directions of the research group:
Taking bats as the research object, I will answer the molecular mechanism that can coexist with Ebola and SARS- associated corona
virus for a long time without causing disease, and its relationship with flight and longevity. Virology, immunology, cell biology, and
multiple omics are used to compare the differences between humans and other mammals.
Why is this notable? Because as it turns out, this is a job posting for the lab of Dr. Peng Zhou (S), Ph.D., a researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology
and Leader of the Bat Virus Infection and Immunization Group. Some more on Zhou's background from the Institute (google translated):
He received his PhD in Wuhan Virus Research Institute in 2010 and has worked on bat virus and immunology in Australia and
Singapore, In 2009 , he took the lead in starting the research on the immune mechanism of bat long-term carrying and
transmittng virus in the world. So far, he has published more than 30 SCI articles, including the first and corresponding author's
Nature , Cell Host Microbe and PNAS. At present, research on bat virus and immunology is continuing, and it has received support
from the National ""You Qing"" Fund, the pilot project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the major project of the Ministry of
Science and Technology.
Below is a list of several recent papers published by Dr. Zhou
‚Ä¢ Dampened STING-Dependent Interferon Activation in Bats
‚Ä¢ Fatal swine acute diarrhoea syndrome caused by an HKU2-related coronavirus of bat origin
‚Ä¢ IFNAR2-dependent gene expression profile induced by IFN-a in Pteropus alecto bat cells and impact of IFNAR2 knockout on virus infection
