O HOW IT SPREADS
Novel coronavirus first spread to humans from an animal ‚Äì thought to be a
snake - at the South China Seafood Wholesale Market.
The virus is transmitted between humans in droplets from coughing and
sneezing and touching or shaking hands.
E HOW IT CAN KILL
Most victims of the virus die from complications including pneumonia and
swelling in the lungs.
The virus also causes swelling in the respiratory system, which can make it
hard for the lungs to pass oxygen into the bloodstream ‚Äì leading to organ
failure and death.
Severe pneumonia can kill people by causing them to 'drown' in the fluid
flooding their lungs.

 USC aims to allow
financial institutions to pay for securities, such as bonds and equities, using the
cryptocurrency to avoid waiting for traditional money transfers to be completed. 

https://t.co/aWTGXjh4ce https://t.co/OFODXWaArh","A decentralized cryptocurrency system can be launched by a single bank or
a number of banks who come together to facilitate payments or clearing and
settlement. In the case of a single bank, the bank may use the cryptocurrency within
its own network or give other users access to the system. In its labs, Citi is testing
CitiCoin, an open source Bitcoin-based digital currency, which will be used for global
payments and trade. Japan's Mitsubishi MUFG coin provides an example where the
system will be open to other users such as those currently on prepaid systems.
In the case where banks partner to launch a decentralized cryptocurrency, the DCL
is controlled by the members and a minimum number of members must sign the
block to make it valid. The banks will set up their own governance structure and
rules, and determine the supply and issue of the cryptocurrency. These systems
have to conform to KYB or KYC procedures. A good example of such a system is the
Utility Settlement Coin (USC).
Four banks, UBS, Deutsche Bank, Santander and BNY Mellon have joined forces
to create their own cryptocurrency, USC, which they plan to launch in 2018. The
banks expect USC to become the industry standard for blockchain settlements
and want to use the new cryptocurrency in transactions between their branches
to facilitate operations, reducing transactions time and costs. USC aims to allow
financial institutions to pay for securities, such as bonds and equities, using the
cryptocurrency to avoid waiting for traditional money transfers to be completed.
The main difference between USC and Bitcoin is that the four banks will be the
centralized issuer of the currency.?

ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW
Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses
that are common among animals. In rare
cases, they are what scientists call zoonotic,
meaning they can be transmitted from
animals to humans.
The viruses can make people sick, usually
with a mild to moderate upper respiratory
tract illness, similar to a common cold.

of Science and Technology.
The main research directions of the research group:
Taking bats as the research object, I will answer the molecular mechanism that can coexist with Ebola and SARS- associated corona
virus for a long time without causing disease, and its relationship with flight and longevity. Virology, immunology, cell biology, and
multiple omics are used to compare the differences between humans and other mammals.
Why is this notable? Because as it turns out, this is a job posting for the lab of Dr. Peng Zhou (S), Ph.D., a researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology
and Leader of the Bat Virus Infection and Immunization Group. Some more on Zhou's background from the Institute (google translated):
He received his PhD in Wuhan Virus Research Institute in 2010 and has worked on bat virus and immunology in Australia and
Singapore, In 2009 , he took the lead in starting the research on the immune mechanism of bat long-term carrying and
transmittng virus in the world. So far, he has published more than 30 SCI articles, including the first and corresponding author's
Nature , Cell Host Microbe and PNAS. At present, research on bat virus and immunology is continuing, and it has received support
from the National ""You Qing"" Fund, the pilot project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the major project of the Ministry of
Science and Technology.
Below is a list of several recent papers published by Dr. Zhou
‚Ä¢ Dampened STING-Dependent Interferon Activation in Bats
‚Ä¢ Fatal swine acute diarrhoea syndrome caused by an HKU2-related coronavirus of bat origin
‚Ä¢ IFNAR2-dependent gene expression profile induced by IFN-a in Pteropus alecto bat cells and impact of IFNAR2 knockout on virus infection
‚Ä¢ Immunogenicity of the spike glycoprotein of Bat SARS-like coronavirus
‚Ä¢ Bat severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus ORF36 homologues display different interferon antagonist activities
